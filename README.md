Current Functional Workflow
Admin Dashboard:

Add issuers and verifiers.
Register users with basic information and store it on the blockchain and backend.
Issuer Dashboard:

Issue credentials for a user (data hash stored on the blockchain).
Revoke credentials if necessary.
Verifier Dashboard:

Verify if a user's credentials are valid or not using the blockchain.
Outcome after Verification
Once the verifier successfully verifies a credential, the following has been achieved:

The identity of the user is validated.
The integrity of the credential (data hash) is confirmed.
The verifier ensures that the credential has not been revoked.
This fulfills the primary objective of your project: using blockchain for secure, immutable, and decentralized identity verification.
